Usually choose the contact records' phone number field and/or mobile phone number field.</li> <li>Message: Define the SMS content (Figure, step 2).</li> </ul> <p>Using the example in the figure, the workflow will enroll a contact record with a deal amount over 100,000 and send an SMS to the enrolled contact automatically. For instance, if a contact named Dean Porter has a deal with an amount of 150,000 and the contact owner for Dean is Grace Tao, Dean will receive a message sent from Grace Porter's RingCentral number to his phone number with the content: \"Hi Dean Porter, one of our specialists will reach out to you soon for the deal. Have a nice day!\" The workflow uses Grace's RingCentral account to send the SMS as if Grace does it herself. Please ensure the contact owner (Grace Tao in this case) has a valid RingCentral account and is able to sign in to RingCentral for HubSpot.</p> <p></p> <p>Workflow results and errors will be tracked in HubSpot workflow action logs (see figure).

Users may see this message on the HubSpot logged call for multiple reasons:</p> <ul> <li>If the call was not recorded from the RingEx by RingCentral integration, the call recording is not added to the call log. We recommend checking the RingCentral Admin Portal (service.ringcentral.com) Call Log reports to see if the call recordings exist. This applies to both on-demand and automatic call recordings.</li> <li>If a user closes the HubSpot integration (by clicking the 'X' button on the integration) immediately after the call is completed, it will terminate the call-log sync API call that updates the call log with necessary information such as call recording and call duration. It is recommended not to close the integration after the call ends; users can navigate to other HubSpot pages or browser tabs instead.</li> <li>If users check the call log for the call recording soon after the call has just ended, they are more likely to see the message 'This call wasn't recorded'.</li> </ul> <p>Here is background information on how this feature works: When the Integration is logging the call during the active call period and immediately after the call has ended, it uses telephony session data to log the call. This data does not contain recording information. The Integration must wait until it receives the same call data from the call-log API to obtain the recording information. The longer the recorded call, the longer the wait time. It can take up to 30 minutes for calls lasting a few hours. There is no clear estimation of the delay as it depends on the recorded call time and possibly the server load.</p>"},{"location":"hubspot/questions/#q-why-are-missed-call-queue-calls-not-logged-to-hubspot","title":"Q. Why are missed call queue calls not logged to HubSpot?","text":"<p>A. Missed call queue calls are not logged to HubSpot for the following reason:</p> <p>If a call is missed by one member and picked up by another, multiple records would be created as one member logs it as a missed call, while another logs it as a connected call. This issue becomes more complex if the queue rings all members simultaneously. To address this problem, the application now ignores Call Queue calls that are ringing and appear to be missed by the current user. Ringing queue calls are ignored because the outcome of the call can only be determined after it's been picked up by someone or completely missed by the account. Missed calls are ignored as presumably another member will pick up the call and log it.</p> <p>This behavior is intentional. The call should be logged by another member if it is picked up. If the call is completely missed, it will likely not be logged. The logic to log this would conflict with the logic to avoid duplications. As a workaround, users should follow the server-side call logging logic, which requires an admin to complete the setup in the integration console (integrations.ringcentral.com) and enable Activity Sync. Our server component handles the logging of calls and will be able to log missed call queue calls correctly, as the service sees the call logs from the standpoint of the entire account.</p>"},{"location":"hubspot/questions/#q-why-are-the-notes-overridden-in-the-call-log-after-the-call-is-logged-to-hubspot","title":"Q.

Why are missed call queue calls not logged to Salesforce?","text":"<p>A. Below is the reason why missed call queue calls are not logged to Salesforce,</p> <p>If a call is missed by one member and picked up by another, multiple records will be created as one member logs it as a missed call, while another logs it as a connected call. The situation worsens if the queue rings all members at once. To address this problem, the application now ignores Call Queue calls that are ringing and appear to be missed by the current user. Ringing queue calls are ignored because we can only determine the outcome of the call after it's been picked up by someone or completely missed by the account. Missed calls are ignored as presumably some other member will pick up the call and log it.</p> <p>The above behavior is intended. The call should be logged by another member if it is picked up. If the call is completely missed, it will likely not be logged. The logic to log this would conflict with the logic to avoid duplications. As a workaround, users should follow the server-side call logging logic, which requires an admin to complete the setup in the integration console (integrations.ringcentral.com) and enable Activity Sync. Our server component handles the logging of calls and will be able to log missed call queue calls correctly, as the service sees the call logs from the standpoint of the entire account.</p>"},{"location":"salesforce/questions/#q-i-have-audio-issues-with-ringcentral-for-salesforce","title":"Q.

However, to log tasks to Accounts, Cases, and Opportunities, follow the solutions mentioned below.</p> <p>How Entity Matching Works:</p> <p>Primary Entity Selection (WhoId) The system selects one primary entity as the \"Who\" field:</p> <ul> <li>Contact/Lead/Person Account: When phone number matches a Contact/Lead/Person Account.</li> </ul> <p>Related Entity Selection (WhatId) The system can set a related entity as the \"What\" field:</p> <ul> <li>Account: Associated company/organization</li> <li>Case: Related support case</li> <li>Opportunity: Related sales opportunity</li> </ul> <p>Why Tasks Don't Appear in Account/Case/Opportunity Activity:</p> <p>Single Task Design</p> <ul> <li>One Task per call - not multiple tasks for different objects</li> <li>WhoId field determines where the task appears in Contact/Lead Activity</li> <li>WhatId field determines where the task appears in Account/Case/Opportunity Activity</li> </ul> <p>Lead Priority Issue</p> <p>When a phone number matches a Lead:</p> <ul> <li>WhoId = Lead ID</li> <li>WhatId = empty/null</li> <li>Result: Task only appears in Lead Activity</li> </ul> <p>Missing Related-To Association</p> <ul> <li>When Contact is primary but no Account/Case/Opportunity is associated:</li> <li>WhoId = Contact ID</li> <li>WhatId = empty/null</li> <li>Result: Task only appears in Contact Activity</li> </ul> <p>Solutions:</p> <p>Solution 1: Manual Related-To Association (Most Reliable) Step-by-Step Process:</p> <ol> <li>Complete the call and let it auto-log</li> <li>Open the call log from the widget</li> <li>Click on the \"Related To\" field</li> <li>Search for the appropriate record:<ul> <li>Account: Company/organization name</li> <li>Case: Case number or subject</li> <li>Opportunity: Opportunity name</li> </ul> </li> <li>Select the record and save the task</li> </ol> <p>Expected Result:</p> <ul> <li>WhoId: Contact/Lead ID</li> <li>WhatId: Account/Case/Opportunity ID</li> <li>Task appears in: Both Contact/Lead Activity AND Account/Case/Opportunity Activity</li> </ul> <p>Solution 2: Click-to-Dial from Related Record For Account/Case/Opportunity Association:</p> <ul> <li>Navigate to the Account/Case/Opportunity record in Salesforce</li> <li>Use Click-to-Dial from the Account/Case/Opportunity page</li> <li>System automatically sets Account/Case/Opportunity as Related-To</li> </ul> <p>(Beta - Feature)</p> <p>Solution 3: Configure Object Priority in Integration Console Admin Configuration:</p> <ol> <li>Go to RingCentral Admin Console</li> <li>Navigate to Integration Console &gt; Salesforce</li> <li>Configure Object Priority Settings:<ul> <li>Set Account as higher priority than Lead</li> <li>Set Case as higher priority than Lead (if applicable)</li> <li>Set Opportunity as higher priority than Lead (if applicable)</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Troubleshooting:</p> <p>If Task Still Doesn't Appear in Related Record Activity:</p> <ul> <li>Check Task field values - ensure WhatId is populated</li> <li>Verify record relationships in Salesforce</li> <li>Check Integration Console settings for object priority</li> <li>Review call log configuration for field mappings</li> </ul> <p>If Related-To Field is Not Available:</p> <ul> <li>Check user permissions for the related object</li> <li>Verify field-level security settings</li> <li>Ensure the related record exists and is accessible</li> </ul> <p>Summary: The key is understanding that Salesforce creates one Task per call, and the WhatId field determines where the task appears in related record Activity. By using the Related-To field to manually associate Account/Case/Opportunity records, or by initiating calls from the appropriate record context, you can ensure tasks appear in both the Contact/Lead Activity and the related record Activity. Following these solutions will create tasks in Account/Case/Opportunity Activity.</p>"},{"location":"salesforce/questions/#q-click-to-dial-or-sms-feature-is-not-enabled-after-refreshing-the-salesforce-page","title":"Q.

Why don't I see caller ID when there is an incoming call to the call queue in Salesforce CTI?","text":"<p>A. This is expected behavior in the Salesforce CTI integration. Caller ID information is not displayed for call queue calls due to the way the system handles queue-based routing and privacy considerations.</p> <p>Root Cause Analysis:</p> <p>1. Call Queue Call Handling When calls come through a call queue, the Salesforce CTI integration treats them differently from direct calls:</p> <ul> <li>Queue calls are routed through the call queue system before reaching individual agents</li> <li>Caller information is masked during the queue routing process for privacy and security</li> <li>The system prioritizes queue management over individual caller identification</li> </ul> <p>2. Privacy and Security Considerations The integration is designed to protect caller privacy when calls are routed through queues:</p> <ul> <li>Caller ID masking prevents unauthorized access to caller information</li> <li>Queue-based routing ensures calls are distributed according to business rules</li> <li>Agent-level restrictions limit what information is visible during queue calls</li> </ul> <p>3. Technical Implementation The Salesforce CTI integration has specific logic for handling call queue calls:</p> <ul> <li>Queue calls bypass normal caller ID display mechanisms</li> <li>System focuses on queue name and call routing information</li> <li>Caller details are intentionally withheld until the call is properly routed</li> </ul> <p>Solutions and Workarounds:</p> <p>Solution 1: Use Queue Name Tooltip (Available Feature)</p> <ul> <li>Hover over the call queue name in the CTI interface</li> <li>Wait for the tooltip to appear (short delay)</li> <li>View the complete queue information in the tooltip</li> <li>This provides queue-specific details about the incoming call</li> </ul> <p>Solution 2: Check Call Assignment</p> <ul> <li>Wait for the call to be assigned to an agent</li> <li>Caller information may become available after assignment</li> <li>Check the call details once the call is in progress</li> </ul> <p>Why This Design Exists:</p> <ol> <li>Queue Management Priority</li> <li>Privacy Protection</li> <li>Performance Optimization</li> </ol> <p>Summary: The absence of caller ID for call queue calls is intentional behavior in the Salesforce CTI integration. This design prioritizes queue management, protects caller privacy, and optimizes system performance. While caller ID is not displayed during queue routing, users can access queue information through the hover tooltip feature and may see caller details once the call is assigned to an agent.</p> <p>This is not a bug or configuration issue, but rather the expected behavior for queue-based call handling in the Salesforce CTI system.</p>"},{"location":"salesforce/questions/#q-why-cant-i-change-my-presence-in-ringcentral-for-salesforce-cti-it-always-stays-on-invisible-presence-and-i-cannot-switch-to-busyavailable","title":"Q.

Why are SMS messages not automatically logged in Salesforce?","text":"<p>A. There could be several factors contributing to SMS messages not being automatically logged. First, we need to check if the SMS was logged after a certain delay. Message synchronization is not in real-time, so it might have some delay, but eventually, the SMS will be logged to Salesforce. Users can expect up to 8-10 minutes of delay in SMS logging.</p> <p>The SMS auto-logging issue might occur when multiple person accounts or contacts share the same phone number. The system can't determine which record to log to, resulting in 'no match' in the Name field. To resolve this, ensure each phone number is unique across your person accounts and contacts, or merge duplicate records if they represent the same person.</p> <p>Another factor to consider is that the conversation needs to have a selected match to appear in activities. It doesn't matter if the heading shows the correct name, but no contact is selected in the Name dropdown. Typically, if there is a single match, our app will try to select that, but sometimes the app may see other viable options and leave this unselected. </p> <p>In conclusion, in multiple match scenarios, select the contact to log an SMS, and in single match scenarios, ensure that the Name field is selected correctly to log an SMS.</p>"},{"location":"salesforce/user-calls/","title":"Calls","text":""},{"location":"salesforce/user-calls/#calls","title":"Calls","text":""},{"location":"salesforce/user-calls/#quick-navigation","title":"Quick Navigation","text":"<ul> <li>Call mode setting - Configure calling modes and environment requirements</li> <li>Audio setting - Set up audio input/output devices and permissions</li> <li>Region setting - Configure location and phone number formatting</li> <li>Dialer page layout - Understand the dialer interface</li> <li>Call history page layout - View and manage call history</li> <li>Outbound calls - Make calls using Click to Dial, Call back, and Dialer</li> <li>Inbound calls - Handle incoming calls and notifications</li> <li>Call Control - Control calls with mute, hold, transfer, and recording</li> <li>Call logging - Log calls to Salesforce and manage auto-logging</li> </ul>"},{"location":"salesforce/user-calls/#call-mode-setting","title":"Call mode setting","text":"<p>RingCentral for Salesforce provides 4 calling modes.

Only users with appropriate permissions will receive assigned tickets.</li> <li>If the Zendesk admin selects the 'Admin-based access' option, then it will always be admin-specific ticket assignment.
