# General Questions

## Q. Why cannot I install Scheduler integration in the Outlook?

A. The RingCentral Scheduler Add-in is currently designed for the classic Outlook (both desktop and web versions). The new Outlook has limited add-in support and is still in development by Microsoft. Many Office Add-ins, including ours, are not fully compatible with the new Outlook yet.

When the customer installed the Scheduler from the RingCentral App Gallery and saw "successfully added to your account," the add-in was indeed added to their Microsoft 365 account - but it won't appear in the new Outlook because the new Outlook doesn't fully support third-party add-ins yet.

**Workaround - Switch to Classic Outlook:**

To use the RingCentral Scheduler Add-in, the customer needs to switch back to classic Outlook:
- In the new Outlook, look for a toggle switch at the top-right that says "New Outlook"
- Turn this toggle OFF
- Outlook will reload and switch back to classic Outlook
- The RingCentral Scheduler should now appear in calendar events

If the customer must use the new Outlook, they can use these alternatives to schedule RingCentral meetings:
- Outlook Web (classic version): https://outlook.office.com
- RingCentral Desktop App: Schedule meetings directly from the app
- RingCentral Web App: https://app.ringcentral.com

Microsoft's new Outlook is a complete rewrite of the Outlook client and doesn't yet support all the add-in features that classic Outlook does. Microsoft is gradually adding add-in support to the new Outlook, but it's still limited compared to classic Outlook. Please ask the customer to switch back to classic Outlook using the toggle and check if the Scheduler appears. If issues continue, request a screenshot from classic Outlook and Outlook version for further investigation.
