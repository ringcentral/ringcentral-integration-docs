# Syncing RingCentral data backup to cloud storage

Once you connect your RingCentral account to a cloud storage account, you'll be redirected to **Sync Options (A)**, where the **Turn On Backup (B)** box is checked by default. You can uncheck the box if you want to disable cloud backup.
Select the data you want to back up (C), then click **Save (D)**. Archiver will automatically back up new data based on your selections. The backup data will appear in the RingCentral folder of your cloud storage account within 24 hours.

Note: Archiver won't back up the data generated before it was connected to the account.
Once the setup is complete, the RingCentral Archiver creates the following folder structure in the connected account or server:
