When RingCentral for Salesforce has been installed and configured by the administrator of the organization, the end-users can find the RingCentral CTI within Salesforce.

This part of the guide will show how to access the RingCentral CTI and the basic login process.

## Launch the RingCentral for Salesforce

RingCentral for Salesforce will create a Salesforce App named RingCentral for Lightning. Users can find this app in the Salesforce App Launcher if the user has been granted access to this App.

In some organizations, the Admins might decide to hide this app from end-users or add the CTI to some other apps. In this case, ask the organization's admin where the CTI app is located within Salesforce.

For any apps the CTI has been added to, the end-users can find the CTI entrance on the button of the page.
